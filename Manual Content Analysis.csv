6,The scent is nice but I can't say that I smell this detergent on my laundry when it dries. I bought this because my son has eczema and I don't like having to buy unscented detergents.

7,Well I‚Äôve used this for a while and apparently it‚Äôs the reason all our close smell not clean and like they‚Äôve been sitting in the washer for days. I had switched to this because we bought a house on septic and I noticed my detergent I usually used was leaving a white crust over our leech line. I remember being told that certain soaps and detergents are bad for septics systems so I bought this and the leech line area improved extremely and I do not smell the septic anymore however my clothes do not smell clean after being washed.

13,"I really like the smell of these and I love the idea of them as well. I just don't feel that they really clean. I Really love the hand soap and will for sure keep buying it. My grandmother really liked the multi-purpose cleaner, she thought it did a really good job, I wasn't supper impressed with it myself though. The bathroom cleaner was my favorite smell wise but was the one I questioned the most when cleaning with, I felt like I was cleaning with just water and the bathroom is the one place where I want to be 100% sure I'm cleaning well. I would definitely recommend giving them a shot though as me and my grandmother had very different opinions on them so maybe you'll be more impressed than I was.

15,Cleaners work ok but would recommend any hevey cleaning with them. Handsoap is good. Bottles not so good... Cleaner bottles broke after couple of uses.

16,I love the concept of it all to begin with. The handsoap however I find very watery. I have trouble with one of the larger spray bottles....the trigger doesn't work well. There really isn't much of a scent which I miss a little but it's not a deal breaker. There was a code for 3 free tablets in the box however you need to buy other products in order to redeem.

17,"I ordered the the piece set- a multipurpose cleaner, bathroom cleaner and hand soap. They sent me two of the same bottles (both yellow) so that it‚Äôs impossible to tell the different cleaners apart. Aside from that, the spray nozzles on both bottles leak TERRIBLY. Aside from that, the cleaner bottles are plastic (probably could have learned that if I‚Äôd read more closely, but still not the glass I was expecting). I like the scents and the hand soap works adequately (not a lot of sud); the bottle for the hand soap is nice.

 I really wanted to like this. I like the idea behind the company and I am trying to avoid single-use plastics. However, this just didn't pan out. I was concerned with the longevity of the spray bottles considering that they're reusable. However, when it breaks on the first use, then I'm not really cutting down on my single-use plastics. And the other bottle just keeps leaking, though I'm not sure from where. Every time I pick it up, there's a puddle underneath.

Sorry for the wobbly video, I was trying to show that I toggled the spray bottle off and then on again.

PROs:
+ Quick delivery
+ Straight forward instructions
+ Only need water
+ Biodegradable packaging
+ Foaming handsoap bottle is durable and made of glass

CONs:
- Spray bottle for the Multipurpose cleaner broke on the first spray
- Spray bottles are both made of plastic
- Leaking bottle

Handsoap bottle is glass
Both spray bottles are plastic

With that said, the cup leaks a lot, so the leakproof claim is nonsense.

The seal is not great, so if it has air in it and the slightest pressure hits it, it will pop open.

Cleaning is difficult because you really have to scrub the edges. Then drying it is hard because you have to find a way to keep it open to fully dry.

Installation is too complicated because the steps given in the manual is unclear.

No holes available to fix the control box. Needed to drill a pair of hole by myself to fix the control box.

The pipe they have given to cover the metal rod connected to motor is very cheap and if you apply even a little extra pressure it will break

They have given a small screws to hold the pipe covering the motor which is a crap and the screw head will break easily when you tighten with the screw driver

The small size L screw driver which came along bent easily and I was required to find one from my toolset and use that. Because what they sent are of cheap quality

The control button panel is a thin cheap plastic

This actually makes me doubt the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù claim somewhat. I have no proof one way or the other. I only have my experience with other organic cotton products to guide me here.

2nd - Washing up. The mesh bag is much too small to allow the discs to get properly clean in the washing machine, so I used a larger mesh bag I have for other things. Make up stains didn‚Äôt come out making me feel as if I am not using a clean product. Also, the wash cycle leaves the pads shrunk and crumpled up like a fortune cookie.

My only complaint is: the tumbler, straw, and lid are not dishwasher safe. They are hand wash only. It‚Äôs not a huge deal but I don‚Äôt see many people talking about that.
Honestly this maker is awesome, easy to use, makes great coffee, and is fairly small so it doesn‚Äôt take up much counter space. May my ice coffee addiction get worse!

122,"I bought this in an attempt to save money over the cold brew packs that you add to water and let sit overnight.

Pros:
1. You can use any type of ground coffee you want.
2. You'll save money over buying coffee out daily.
3. Less waste than k-cups.
4. Minimal wait time over cold brew packs and no need to have space in the fridge for a pitcher.

Cons:
1. Despite using the same type and amount of coffee and same amount of water, after 30 days of use my coffee tastes watered down almost immediately now.
2. There is no drip tray. Even switching the lever to off, it still drips onto your counters.
3. The basket that the filter goes into isn't very secure and doesn't ""lock"" into the machine.
4. Total time; filling with water, filling the tumbler with ice, adding ground coffee to the basket, letting it brew and then adding your creamer and/or sugar is about 8 minutes. (Coming from cold brew packs this feels like an eternity.)

If your someone who likes a larger amount of coffee in the morning and then a smaller amount in the afternoon, there is no option to make a smaller cup of it (unless you put the rest in the fridge). Overall, I like the machine and it's decent but I don't love it as much as making the cold brew packs.

175,"I love this floss and the container. I started flossing daily using plastic flossers and realized I didn‚Äôt want to be using that much plastic. I found this alternative and it is great!

My responses to reviews I read that made me doubt making the purchase:
1) The edges of the bamboo container were smooth and matched up perfectly. It fits together nice and snug.
2) The floss is grippier than most synthetic floss, but my dentist told me this is ideal and helps remove more tartar and bacteria than smooth floss.
3) The floss doesn‚Äôt break any more than synthetic floss. I have one tooth that is notorious for busting any floss I use. With flossing every day for the last 100 days I have experienced this floss break about 4-6 times.
4) This container seems like it will never run out. 100 days in and I still haven‚Äôt even needed to use my refill spool that came with it.
5) Economical - given the last point, this floss will last me at least 6 months with the initial spool and the refill. Completely worth it.

176,"I found this floss an excellent replacement for the plastic wax floss I used to buy. The crest floss I have used for years used to snap occasionally, but this floss, despite being thinner and feeling finer, hasn't broken once yet. I've only used it for a couple months though, so months vs years is hardly a good comparison. The flavor is light, more like a hint of mint. I don't have any issues sliding between my teeth. Actually being thinner, it's a litter easier to use. Overall I feel it works just as well as the plastic floss.

Only a minor concern is the spot where the floss comes out of the top of the bottle is right next to the metal sliver so you have this super tiny thread just sticking out. It's not terrible to keep it from falling back in the bottle, but it does happen.

Also, after the floss is cut per use, it often gets stuck under the cutting mechanism- if you don‚Äôt have nails, or your nails are too long, you might have to resort to using tweezers to get the tiniest length out from under the cutting mechanism.

235,"I purchased this after searching on Amazon for ""spice infuser"" which I intend to use in pickling this summer. The measurements posted on the site are accurate and I should have used a ruler to see what I was going to get because the actual product was smaller than I imagined. (See my photo of one infuser next to a standard teaspoon.) I'm glad that I bought the two-pack; I expect that I will have to use both infusers to get an adequate seasoning of my pickle brine. These infusers appear to be fine for making a cup of tea or two, but no more. After making a single cup using a scant teaspoon of leaves, the basket was absolutely packed with wet tea leaves. The mesh on the side walls is extremely fine, so tea leaves should not get lodged in them to clog the pores. The holes at the top are a bit larger than those on the side walls, but small enough that tea leaves will not leak into your brew. They are so small, however, that it may require repeated dunking in the cup to allow all the air to escape from around the tea leaves so that the leaves are fully immersed and steeping. The hanging chain and hook appear to be sturdy and the lid is sturdier than the basket itself. I appreciate that the screw-on-cap secures to the cylinder to create a firmer seal than my old tea infusers. The drainage saucer is simply a piece of stamped metal and very shallow. I expect that the only thing that will keep tea from spilling over onto the counter as the infuser drains into it is the surface tension of the liquid. My saucers did not have edges sharp enough to cut me, but a slight variation in the manufacturing process could cause the cutting hazard that another reviewer described. I hope that the edge of the cylinder seal is more sturdy than it looks. It appears to be stamped or soldered in six places to seal it. I fear that the edges may separate after a moderate period of use. When the overall quality of this product is considered, I could imagine that if they were sold individually at the Dollar Store, the manufacturer would still make a decent profit.","ergonomics, safety","small, sturdy, hazard, cutting",  ,3.0,Negative

It still works fine and I've not had problems with the lid, but I will be looking for a new infuser that isn't dangerous.

Happens twice per use - once when you open it to put tea in and then second time when you clean it. The sound makes my hair on my beck stand and even the thought of that sound makes me cringe. The negative-sense reinforcement from that sound was so bad that I always hesitated to make tea until I bought a different type of tea strainer.

There are some other flaws too:
1. Even the smallest one is too big. Most of the container is empty when I used it.
2. The hook is a nice design idea in theory but in practice the hook often falls of the edge of the cup which means you now have to use a fork to pull out the tea-drowned strainer.
3. The bottom container's top edge is a bit sharp and you can hurt yourself if you're not careful when cleaning

- Very lightweight and packs small
- Uses the sun to charge it
- Loops for hanging on various items

Con's:
- Not very durable
- Not very bright

So, if you are looking for something super lightweight that packs down to a small size, this is perfect. It only weights 5.44 ounces, and it packs to about the size of a small cup saucer. You will hardly notice it in your pack when carrying it. Another nice feature of this is that it is solar powered, so you don't have to worry about running out of battery power. Just loop it to the back of your pack with the light's loops, and you can charge it as you hike. These are great features in this little light.

However, this light has some serious downsides in my eyes. The material that it is made out of just feels really soft and flimsy. I just don't see it really holding up well walking in the woods. It seems to me that it would be really easy to poke this with a thorn accidentally and just ruin the whole thing. Also, it really is not that bright. Even on the brightest setting, it did not put out much light. You would not be able to use it for much other than to light the small immediately surrounding area. For that reason, I don't see much need to even carry this light on a hike. I'd say go with something else.

At first I tried just having to LIMIT EVEN MORE my already too limited amount of coffee so that the top of the total amount of coffee in the cup was lower...not happy.
