# Domain-Specific Aspect Extraction for Product Design

## Overview
This document presents a comprehensive study on aspect extraction for product design using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It focuses on analyzing customer reviews to extract meaningful insights that can inform product design improvements. The study employs various word embedding and clustering techniques to identify and isolate key product aspects from text data.

## Abstract
The paper explores the effectiveness of different NLP algorithms in identifying and extracting aspects from product reviews. Aspect extraction is critical in understanding customer sentiments and enhancing product design by focusing on specific features highlighted in user feedback.

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Introduction**: Outlines the relevance of the study and its significance in the context of product design.
2. **Aspect Extraction for Product Design**: Discusses the challenges and methodologies in aspect extraction specifically tailored for product design.
3. **Datasets and Word Embeddings**: Describes the datasets used for the study and the preprocessing steps involved. It also details the word embedding techniques employed.
4. **Unsupervised Aspect Extraction**: Explains the unsupervised learning methods used to detect aspects from reviews.
5. **Experimental Results**: Presents the results of the experiments, including comparisons of different clustering techniques and their effectiveness in aspect extraction.
6. **Conclusions and Future Work**: Summarizes the findings and outlines future research directions.

## Experimentation
The paper includes experimental analysis using three main datasets:
- Amazon Product Reviews
- Beer Reviews
- Restaurant Reviews

Word embeddings utilized include Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT, along with clustering algorithms like K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).

## Conclusions
The study concludes that the combination of GloVe embeddings with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) provides the most insightful results for aspect extraction in product design. Future work will explore more advanced models and fine-tuning of embeddings to enhance the accuracy and applicability of aspect extraction.
